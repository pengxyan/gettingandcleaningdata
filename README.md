Peer Assessment Project for Getting and Cleaning Data

The script run_analysis.R should be saved in the current working directory.

The data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip should be download and extracted to the sub-directory under the working directory, getdata-projectfiles\UCIHARDataset\ in this case. The Script run_analysis.R can be executed to output the result to a text file named tidyset.txt in the working directory.

A file CodeBook.md is also available in the directory.
